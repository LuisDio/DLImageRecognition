# Image-Recognition

This is a step by step application development that use Deep Learning algorithm approach with Keras and tensorflow to create system that can recognize `objects` in photographs.

This project can be included in any other application for image recognition system.

To begin you need to install tools that will be required for the development.

First we will install `python 3.6.6`
